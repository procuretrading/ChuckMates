# GitHub Upload Instructions

## IMPORTANT: How to Upload the Zip File to GitHub

### Step 1: Extract the Zip First!

**DO NOT upload the .zip file itself to GitHub!**

1. Download `github-upload.zip`
2. **Extract/Unzip it** on your computer
3. You should now have a folder called `github-upload` with these files inside:
   - index.html
   - about.html
   - platinum-series.html
   - premium-series.html
   - adapters.html
   - sitemap.xml
   - robots.txt
   - README.md
   - css/ (folder)
   - images/ (folder)

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/procuretrading/YOURREPONAME
2. Click "uploading an existing file" or "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. **Open the extracted `github-upload` folder**
4. **Select ALL the files and folders** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
5. **Drag them all at once** into the GitHub upload area
   - OR: Click "choose your files" and select all of them
6. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Wait for Upload

- GitHub will upload all files
- This might take 1-2 minutes
- You'll see all your files appear in the repository

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: "main" / "/ (root)"
4. Click Save
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

Your site will be live at: `https://procuretrading.github.io/YOURREPONAME/`

## Troubleshooting

**If you can only drag one file at a time:**
- Try using Ctrl+A (Windows) or Cmd+A (Mac) to select all files
- Try using "choose your files" button instead of drag-and-drop
- Make sure you're dragging FROM the extracted folder, not the .zip file

**If files don't appear in correct structure:**
- Make sure you extracted the zip first
- Make sure you're uploading the CONTENTS of the github-upload folder, not the folder itself
